In this application, I took data from https://www.themoviedb.org/ using Alamofire and Kinfisher and showed it to the user.

HOME PAGE :

1. I showed the movies that are currently showing using CollectionView. By using Burata Timer feature, I made the movies scroll automatically.
2. I have listed the upcoming movies and their properties using TableView.
3. Using SearchBar, I enabled the user to search for the desired movie.
4. Clicking on any movie displays the Detail page.

DETAIL PAGE:
1. The image of the selected movie, imdb score, name and information about the movie are displayed.
2. Movies similar to the selected movie are displayed with CollectionView.
